        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p class="detailP">
            You can select normal, daytime or night mode. After you selected mode, you can set and view the setup and effect of the corresponding mode.
        </p>
        <h2>Profile Management</h2>
        <p class="detailP">
            It works with the configuration files. You can select normal/daytime/night mode according to your actual requirements.
        </p>
        <h2>Brightness</h2>
        <p class="detailP">
            It is to adjust monitor window brightness via the nonlinear mode. The larger the number is, the bright the video is. Please note the video may become hazy if the value is too high. The recommended value ranges from 40 to 60. The default value is 50.
        </p>
        <h2>Contrastness</h2>
        <p class="detailP">
            It is to adjust monitor window contrast. The larger the number is, the higher the contrast is. Please note the video may become hazy if the value is too low. If this value is too high, the dark section may lack brightness while the bright section may over exposure .The recommended value ranges from 40 to 60. The default value is 50.
        </p>
        <h2>Saturation</h2>
        <p class="detailP">
            It is to adjust monitor window saturation. The larger the number is, the strong the color is. This value has no effect on the general brightness of the whole video. The recommended value ranges from 40 to 60. The default value is 50.
        </p>
        <h2>Sharpness</h2>
        <p class="detailP">
            It is to adjust the sharpness of the video edge. The higher the value is, the clearer the edge is and vice versa. There may be noise if the value is too high. The default value is 50 and the recommended value ranges from 40 to 60.
        </p>
		<h2>Gamma</h2>
        <p class="detailP">
            The threshold here is to adjust video brightness via the nonlinear mode to enhance video dynamic display range. The larger the number is, the bright the video is. The default value is 50 and the recommended value ranges from 40 to 60.
        </p>
		<h2>Mirror</h2>
        <p class="detailP">
            It is to switch video left and right direction.This function is disabled by default.
        </p>
        <h2>Flip</h2>
