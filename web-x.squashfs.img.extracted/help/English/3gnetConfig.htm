            <br/>
            1. SIM card does not support hotswap function. Hotswap operation may burn down the SIM. You need to reboot 4G module after you insert a SIM card, otherwise system can not detect the new card.
            <br/>
            2. System can not receive/send out message, receive incoming card or 4G dial if there is no SIM card.
