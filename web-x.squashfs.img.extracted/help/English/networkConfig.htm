            TCP/IP mode is to set device login IP. It supports IPV4 and IPV6. IPV4 supports static IP and DHCP IP,IPV6 only supports static IP. After you set the IP address manually, Web interface can automatically go to the login interface of the new IP.

If you select the static mode, you need to set the IP/sub mask/gateway manually；If you select the DHCP mode, you can view the IP/sub mask/gateway from the DHCP. 
If you switch from the DHCP mode to the static mode, you need to reset the IP parameters.

                        1.It is for all the IPV6 address to check the validity. The IP address and the default gateway shall be in the same network section. That is to say, you need to set the subnet prefix field shall have the same length so that it can pass the verification.
                        <br />
                        2.When PPPOE is enabled, the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway of the IPV4 or IPv6 is read-only and can not restore the default setup.

            When it is enabled by default, during the reboot process, you can use the specified ping packet to set the device IP within 2 minutes. The service turns off after 2 minutes. The service also becomes off if you successfully set the IP address. The Ping function can not set the IP address if current function is disabled.
